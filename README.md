## About me
Hi, I'm Ngoc Anh! I have an analytical background in apps product and gaming industry. Over 2 years working in this area, I have built a strong background and nutured passion for analysing data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical skills and analysis to into solving problems and make important decisions to improve the products effectively

During my studies and experience, I honed my ability to work with complex data to indentify patterns and trends. I am used to working with SQL, Excel, Python, Looker, Power BI, and also Tableau, to keep track the product's performance and find out the issues related if any. Also, Having experience in statistical analysis, data tracking and management, data pipeline, together with other related certificates, has helped me gained valuable assets to work in this field

I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics topics.

## Projects
Below are my hands-on data analytics projects

### Analysis of performance of Racing Pass - in-apps time-limited event 

**Query**: 

**Goal**: Evaluate the effectiveness of racing pass event in terms of monetization and time length

**Description**: This analysis focuses on evaluating the key metrics monitoring the performance of the feature Racing Pass - the most important event in terms of monetization for the game Asphalt 8. The main metrics are: daily players, daily revenue, conversion rate, ARPDAU, retention rate, session length. 
The analysis process involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), making comparision between seasons with different period

**Skills**: SQL query, data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization

**Technology**: SQL, Snowflake, Excel

**Result**: 4-week racing pass performs better than the 3-week one, with more daily active players, higher retention rate, conversion rate, and ARPDAU. The findings leads to decision to officially apply the 4-week time frame, customize the IAP bundles and rewards for each user's segmentation, thus boosing daily sales by 17%

### Analysis of user's purchasing behavior in game apps

**Query**: 

**Goal**: Find out user's segmentation for each bundle, when and where they make purchases in game

**Description**: 

**Skills**: SQL query, data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization

**Technology**: SQL, Snowflake, Excel

**Result**: 4-week racing pass performs better than the 3-week one, with more daily active players, higher retention rate, conversion rate, and ARPDAU. The findings leads to decision to officially apply the 4-week time frame, customize the IAP bundles and rewards for each user's segmentation, thus boosing daily sales by 17%

### Analysis of new users's behaviors in app (First-time-user-experiences analysis)

**Query**: 

**Goal**: Find out where new users churn the most after they first install and open the apps, thus making decision to improve the situation

**Description**: Retention rate day 1 was on the downward trend, so this analysis was conducted to find out the pain points where new users quit the game after they install, how far and how long they had been in game until they left.

**Skills**: SQL query, data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization

**Technology**: SQL, Snowflake, Excel, Power BI 

**Result**: Users quit the most in the loading screen, followed by age gate and shop tutorial. The insights helped the development teams to come up with solutions to optimize loading process, re-design the age gate and shop, reducing churn rate by 2%
