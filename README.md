Hi, I'm Ngoc Anh! I have an analytical background in apps product and gaming industry. Over 2 years working in this area, I have built a strong background and nutured passion for analysing data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical skills and analysis to into solving problems and making important decisions to improve the products effectively

During my studies and experience, I honed my ability to work with complex data to indentify patterns and trends. I am used to working with SQL, Excel, Python, Looker, Power BI, and also Tableau, providing dashboards and analysis to monitor product's performance . Also, Having experience in statistical analysis, data tracking and management, data pipeline, together with other related certificates, has helped me gained valuable assets to continue develop myself in this field

I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

Below is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics topics.

## Projects
Below are my hands-on data analytics projects

- SQL

### Analysis of in-apps time-limited event 

**Query**: 

**Goal**: Evaluate the effectiveness of Racing Pass event in terms of monetization aspect 

**Description**: This analysis focuses on evaluating performance of the feature Racing Pass - the most important event in terms of monetization for the game Asphalt 8. The main metrics are: daily players, daily revenue, conversion rate, ARPDAU, retention rate, session length. The process involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), making comparision between seasons with different period

**Skills**: SQL query, data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization

**Technology**: SQL, Snowflake, Excel

**Result**: 4-week racing pass performs better than the 3-week one, with more daily active players, higher retention rate, conversion rate, and ARPDAU. The findings leads to decision to officially apply the 4-week time frame, customize the IAP bundles and rewards for each user's segmentation, thus boosing daily sales by 17%

### Analysis of churn users in game

**Query**: 

**Goal**: analyze behaviors of churn users by each cohort

**Description**: 

**Skills**: SQL query, data cleaning, data analysis, statistical analysis, data visualization

**Technology**: SQL, Snowflake, Excel

**Result**: The analysis indicated type of users who are likely to quit the most, and possible reasons for churning. The dataset included: daily active users, retention rate, retention cohort, payer cohort, average daily sessions and session length, ads impressions, what features did they engage in,...etc
The findings enable the the decision to release new contents,rewards, IAP bundles for players in different cohorts, increasing retention rates by 1-3%

### Analysis of new users's behaviors in app (First-time-user-experiences analysis)

**Query**: 

**Goal**: Find out where new users churn the most after they first install and open the apps, thus making decision to improve the situation

**Description**: Retention rate day 1 was on the downward trend, so this analysis was conducted to find out the pain points where new users quit after they install, how far and how long they had been in game until they left, then propose possible causes and recommendation to improve

**Skills**: SQL, data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization

**Technology**: SQL, Snowflake, Excel, Power BI 

**Result**: Users quit the most in the first 3 steps of the FTUE. The insights helped the development teams to come up with solutions to optimize loading process, re-design and fasten the tutotial phases, reducing churn rate by 2%

- Python
### A/B testing analysis on advertising
**Code**: [here](https://github.com/Donna164/Data-Analyst--Portfolio/blob/main/ABN%20test%20-%20ads%20options.ipynb)

**Goal**: determine what is more effective between 2 advertisings in terms of monetization, then choose the winner to be displayed in apps, aiming to bringing about more revenue while ensuring good experiences for users

**Description**: ABN test was conducted on 2 advertising options with the same type for 4 days. The user base for this campaign is mainly in the 4 countries, having certain similar patterns and behaviors while using apps. After that, the data analysis was performed to check the significance, make comparision in performance between 3 options

**Skills**: Statiscial techniques and analysis, SQL, Python

**Technology**: VSCode, SQL, Excel

**Result**: The ads of the most appealing rewards won, with the ECPM was 5 times as much as the remaining , while other KPI such as retention rates or sales are not much different. It meant this ads option did not cannibalize other KPI.
